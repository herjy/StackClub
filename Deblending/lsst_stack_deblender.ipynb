    "# Using the LSST Stack Multiband Deblender\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook has been lighted edited to work with DESC environment and DC2 data sets.\n",

    "<br>Owner(s): **Fred Moolekamp** ([@fred3m](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub/issues/new?body=@fred3m))\n",
    "<br>Last Verified to Run: **2020-02-07**\n",
    "<br>Verified Stack Release: **w_2020_04**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to illustrate how to execute the multiband deblender (*scarlet*) in the LSST stack. This includes a brief introduction to LSST stack objects including:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Geometry classes from `lsst.geom`, such as points and boxes.\n",
    " - Higher-level astronomical primitives from `lsst.afw`, such as the `Image`, `Exposure`, and `Psf` classes.\n",
    " - Our core algorithmic `Task` classes, including those for source detection, deblending, and measurement.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll be working with coadded images made from DESC DC2 DR6 WFD, which you can find more information about [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05926).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on Jim Bosch's globular cluster tutorial, however in it's present state *scarlet* is unable to process the crowded field (most likely) due to poor initial conditions for the sources in the field. So instead we use a region of the image outside of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "After working through this tutorial you should be able to: \n",
    "1. Configure and run the LSST multiband deblender on a test list of objects;\n",
    "2. Understand its task context in the DRP pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "This notebook is intended to be runnable on a **large** instance of the LSP on `lsst-lsp-stable.ncsa.illinois.edu` from a local git clone of https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub.\n",

    "The deblender itself sets the `parent` column for each source, which is `0` for objects with no parent, and all of the columns that begin with `deblend_` and also adds new rows to the catalog for each child. It does *not* remove the parent rows it created those child rows from, and this is intentional, because we want to measure both \"interpretations\" of the blend family: one in which there is only one object (the parent version) and one in which there are several (the children). Before doing any science with the outputs of an LSST catalog, it's important to remove one of those interpretations (typically the parent one).  That can be done by looking at the `deblend_nChild` and `parent` fields:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `parent` is the ID of the source from which this was deblended, or `0` if the source is itself a parent.\n",
    " - `deblend_nChild` is the number of child sources this source has (so it's `0` for sources that are themselves children or were never blended).\n",
    " \n",
    "Together, these define two particularly useful filters:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `deblend_nChild == 0`: never-blended object or de-blended child\n",
    " - `deblend_nChild == 0 and parent == 0`: never-blended object\n",
    " \n",
    "The first is what you'll usually want to use; the second is what to use if you're willing to throw away some objects (possibly many) because you don't trust the deblender.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last processing step for our purposes is running measurement, which must be done on each catalog, in each band (if we want measurements for all of them):"
